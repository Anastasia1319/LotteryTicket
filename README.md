# LotteryTicket
It is necessary to write a method that takes as input the number of a lottery ticket (the number of digits of which is even from 2 to 8) and
returns a boolean whether the ticket is a winning ticket or not.
A ticket is considered a winner if the sum of the digits of the left half of the number of which
is equal to the sum of the digits of the right half.
